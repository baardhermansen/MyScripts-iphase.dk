#AD Stale computer Object cleanup script
#Should be run as a scheduled task with a gMSA account that has permissions to read computer object attributes and modify/delete them.
#The computer it runs on must have RSAT installed for the ActiveDirectory module to be loaded.
#Suggestion is to run two instances of this script, one for servers and one for workstations

#Requires -Module ActiveDirectory
#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
